    <p>Hello, my name is Scott Davis. I am originally from Missouri. I live in Utah now.<br>
       My favorite food is shrimp.
      I like movies, chocolate, and an occasional hike.<br>
      But really <b>chocolate</b> I can't live without!

    <p>"The nation was founded on July 4, 1776, by the thirteen colonies of Great Britain along the Atlantic coast. <br>
      They issued the Declaration of Independence, which announced their independence from Great Britain and their creation of a cooperative union. <br>
      The disobedient colonies defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, making it the first successful colonial war of independence in history."</p>
