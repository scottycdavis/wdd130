    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Scott Davis" width="200"> <br>
    <p>Hello, my name is Scott Davis. I am originally from Missouri. I live in Utah now.<br>
       My favorite food is shrimp.
      I like movies, chocolate, and an occasional hike.<br>
      But really <b>chocolate</b> I can't live without! <br>
      Did you know that one cocoa bean contains 50% nib and 50% cocoa butter. It's also amazing to note that each 
      cocoa bean has a specific origin and that speicific origin gives it a unique flavor. 
      My favorite cocoa beans are from Madagascar, Ecuador and Belize. The Madagascar have a very fruity
      undertone to them. They taste like a raspberry or cherry even. Whereas Ecuador has more of a nutty flavor to it.
      The reason for this is because the cocoa butter takes in that which is around it. In Ecuador, in the canopy above the cacao
      trees grow almond trees. These flavors mix with the cocoa butter and at harvest time these flavors come out in a very unique
      and beautiful way. 
      It's been amazing all that I've been able to learn as a self taught chocolate maker. I used to hate dark chocolate because it was 
      chalky and was way too bitter. But after creating my own, I can't get enough of it.

    <p>"The nation was founded on July 4, 1776, by the thirteen colonies of Great Britain along the Atlantic coast. <br>
      They issued the Declaration of Independence, which announced their independence from Great Britain and their creation of a cooperative union. <br>
      The disobedient colonies defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, making it the first successful colonial war of independence in history."</p>
