    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to give solid information about white water rafting trips, river safety, and fun family excursions for Riptide Mountains Whitewater Rafting.<br>
       We are also late in the game for building a website. We would like something that appeals to families but also to the high adventure seekers. We have only had a checkin spot
       in the past. Really trying to drive a lot more traffic here and have it represent our rebranding and new look.
       We would love to also be able to embed our weekly YouTube videos here to talk about important water safety practices, best way to row in the high rapids and really how to have a great time out on the river.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Q: Who's are target audience? What is their lifestyle? <br>
       A: Really there are two main groups: families and high adventure seekers. We have the families who want to come out have a great time but we also have those who want to essentially cheat death numerous times.
          They're families that love being outdoors, appreciate nature and want to teach their kids that. The other group are sometimes here because it's the challenge and they're looking to exert themselves and be a one man band in the kayaks.<br>
       <br>   
       Q: How will our audience access our website? What devices will they be on? <br>
       A: I would honestly say anyting and everything. When they're planning these trips you can have dad on his laptop, mom on her ipad and the kids on their cellphones. So it needs to
          work on all devices and not have any hiccups in the end. We want it to be a very user friendly experience but also an informative and professional site. <br>
      <br>
       Q: What will they expect entering this website? <br>
       A: They'll expect professionalism. A very professional, beautiful looking website. It needs to appeal to them. Not just guys in the water. We need to show families working the rivers together.
          Again we need to have video content that shows the family putting on life jackets, helmets, rowing correctly. Things like that I feel would give them more than what they were expecting
          and hopefully we will become their go to for white water rafting.</p>
